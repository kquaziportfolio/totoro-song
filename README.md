# totoro-song
This project is the code for my ENGR1 Lab's Final Robot Show project. The code, when uploaded to an Arduino, performs a series of actions, including playing a song and moving its
arms when a button is pressed. The wiring is as follows:
<ul>
<li>Pin 2 is connected to a button</li>
<li>Pin 3 is connected to 2 LEDs</li>
<li>Pin 8-11 are connected to a stepper motor that is connected to a cardboard strip, making "arms"</li>
<li>Pin 4 is attached to a Servo motor</li>
<li>Pin 7 is connected to a Piezo buzzer</li></ul>
